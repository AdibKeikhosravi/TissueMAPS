Introduction

**tmt** is a Python package that bundles tools for image processing and data analysis in `TissueMAPS <https://github.com/HackerMD/TissueMAPS>`_.

.. _subpackages:

Sub-packages
============

The toolbox provides the following routines:

- **align** - Alignment of images between different acquisition cycles.

- **corilla** - Correction of illumination artifacts.

- **dafu** - Data fusion for `Jterator <https://github.com/HackerMD/Jterator>`_ projects.

- **illuminati** - Creation of image pyramids.

- **visi** - Conversion of `Visiview <http://www.visitron.de/Products/Software/VisiView/visiview.html>`_'s STK files to PNG images with optional renaming.

Each tool comes with a separate API and command line interface, but they all depend on the package wide configuration settings.

Configuration settings
======================

Config file
-----------

The *tmt.config* `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ file specifies the experiment layout, such as the directory structure on disk.

.. literalinclude:: ../tmt/tmt.config
   :language: yaml
..

    NOTE: Quotes are generally not required around strings in YAML syntax, but are necessary here to escape the curly braces in the format strings!


Configuration classes
---------------------

Paths and filenames are described with `Python format strings <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings>`_. The configuration classes replace the **replacement fields** surrounded by curly braces ``{}`` with experiment specific variables and provide the formatted path or filename in form of an attribute.

Definitions
-----------

A **project** represents the folder on disk, which contains the images and corresponding data. This may either be an **experiment** or a **subexperiment**, in case the experiment is made up of several related image acquisition *cycles*, i.e. if you acquired images of the same sample at different time points.

Documentation
=============

We use `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_ in combination with the `Napoleon extension <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon>`_ in order to support the `reStructuredText NumPy style <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard>`_ for docstrings.

To update the documentation upon changes in the source code, do

.. code:: bash

    sphinx-apidoc -o ./docs ./tmt

To build the documentation website, do

.. code:: bash
    
    cd docs
    make html

The generated HTML files are located at `docs/_build/html`.
