# TISSUEMAPS TOOLBOX CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
# =========================================
#
# Configuration of the experiment layout (directory structure and filename
# nomenclature) for image preprocessing, pyramid creation and data
# postprocessing.
#
# The experiment layout is defined by format strings.
# To this end, you can choose from the following keywords:
#
# experiment_dir:      Absolute path to the experiment folder (string)
# experiment:          Name of the experiment folder, i.e. basename of 
#                      'experiment_dir' (string).                  
# subexperiment:       Name of a subdirectory within the experiment folder (string).
# cycle:               Number of the subexperiment (integer).
# channel:             Number of the image in the multi-channel acquisition sequence
#                      corresponding to a particular wavelength (integer).
# objects:             Name of objects in a segmentation{sep}mask image (string).
# jtproject:           Name of a Jterator project folder (string).
