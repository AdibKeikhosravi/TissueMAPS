# Ansible playbook for creating, terminating, starting and stopping virtual
# machine instsances in the cloud. The state of instances is controlled via the
# "instance_state" variable. Note that not all states are provided for all
# implemented providers.
- name: Provision virtual machine instances
  hosts: all
  vars:
    instance_state: present
  # connection: local
  roles:
    - cloud-instance

# # NOTE: This should be included in the above play. However, the "delegate_to"
# # Ansible module is broken, which prevents a combination of local and remote
# # tasks in the play at the moment.
# - include: volume.yml
#   when: instance_state == 'present'
