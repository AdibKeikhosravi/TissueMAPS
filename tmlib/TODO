[ ] further extend class for configuration settings
[ ] implement "brainy"-like workflow
[ ] check .out files for ðŸ˜ž 
[ ] implement alternative jterator mode for loading images (old mode)
[ ] update documentation
[ ] jterator batch_size
[ ] store shift statistics in HDF5 files

[ ] jterator collection step: keep local (image-specific) coordinates in the data files of the corresponding jobs and map them to global map upon collection. Since we read the data for the vector layers directly from the HDFT5 file, this will allow the direct visualization of jterator results on the map!!!
