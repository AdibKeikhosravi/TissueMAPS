        Parameters
        ----------
        user_id: int, optional
            ID of submitting user (if not the user who owns the experiment)

        Returns

        Tuple[int, str]
            ID of the submission and the name of the submitting user

        Warning
        -------
        Ensure that the "submissions" table get updated once the jobs
        were submitted, i.e. added to a running `GC3Pie` engine.
        To this end, use the ::meth:`tmlib.workflow.api.update_submission`
        method.
