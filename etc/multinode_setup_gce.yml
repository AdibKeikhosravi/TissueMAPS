# Template for setting up TissueMAPS on multiple nodes on Google Compute Engine.
#
# The configuration assumes a "tissuemaps" network.
# The "tissuemaps" network restricts access to the TissueMAPS grid (this is highly
# recommended). For production, the node hosting the web server
# (in this case "tissuemaps-slurm-master-001") should get a floating IP
# assigned and a firewall rule that allows ingressing HTTP connections.
#
# This setup depends on groups defined via Elasticluster.
